#Determine If a Piece of Text a Question With Recurrent Neural Networks

Summary of Results: The training dataset consists of two columns of questions and statements with their corresponding classes of questions or not questions taken from Quora Question Pairs Dataset, summaries of Wikipedia articles, and movie lines to have examples that are most similar to everyday language. New parameters were created using Text analysis capabilities of Wolfram Language and different statistical models were applied inside classify function. A linear neural net was created and performed classification with 90% accuracy. Comparably, the best classify function had an accuracy of 85.5%. 

The future work will include improving the accuracy of the neural network by optimizing it's architecture and allowing the network to, for example, comprehend contextual questions.
